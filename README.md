# Rhythm Thief Text Editor (RTTE)
This editor is capable of editing the `EXCL` format authored by Xeen and used in *Rhythm Thief: The Emperor's Treasure*.
It supports most files from the game, however, some don't work as they don't follow the standard `EXCL` specification. Support for those files will come in the future.
